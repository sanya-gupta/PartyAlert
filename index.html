	<h2>Project Description</h2>
	<p>Party Alert is a celebration tool for social events. Whether at a party, a park, or a small family get together Party Alert can be used to amplify the fun. By using our combination of hardware and a mobile application a user can choose a type of alert as well as what will trigger that alert. The types of alerts are blinking LEDs, a speaker, and customizable GPIOs. The alert triggers will be weather related events or a timed alarm. For example, if Party Alert was in use at a social gathering an alert could be set up to go off when the temperature rose above a certain threshold. Eventually we would like add the ability to choose between different sports teams scoring to trigger the alert. The hardware of Party Alert consists of a device with an electronic circuit including an Electric Imp chip, LEDs, a speaker, and GPIO pins. The Electric Imp chip has BlinkUp technology which allows the device to connect to WiFi by being placed near a mobile device connected to a WiFi network. Through Blinkup technology and the many benefits of using Electric Imp our small piece of hardware can connect to the internet to receive any information that may be needed, such as weather information.
